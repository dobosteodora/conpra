Assignments for the Practical Course Algorithms for Programming Contests WS2020/21 at TUM

The practical course consisted of weekly programming assignments covering the following topics (non-exhaustive list): 

1. Data structures (Union Find, Binary Search)
2. Graphs, Minimum Spanning Trees (Kruskal, Prim), DFS, BFS, Topological Sort
3. Shortest Paths (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, Longest Path in DAG)
4. Maximum Flow (Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp, Dinic, Push-Relabel)
5. Backtracking
6. Greedy Approaches (Job Scheduling, Local Search, Facility Location Problem)
7. Number Theory (Sieve of Eratosthenes, EEA, CRT)
8. Dynamic Programming 
9. (Projective) Geometry (Ray Casting Algorithm, Gift-Wrapping, Graham's Scan)
10. Segment Trees & Tries
